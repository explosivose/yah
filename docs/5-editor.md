# Editor

You can create and edit pages, components and data integrations using the web-based editor.

## How it works

The editor displays pages and components with an overlay of editor controls. You can change the layout of pages, add and remove components from pages, and define page routing using the editor controls. You can create and edit components, component variants, and data connections.
